teams and translators.


About this repository
---------------------

Transifex used to be maintained as an open-source project on the side of
Transifex.com. Since mid 2012, this repository is
[no longer actively maintained](https://github.com/transifex/transifex/issues/206#issuecomment-15243207)
in favor of working aggressively in extending Transifex.com itself.

Nowadays there is almost no resemblance between the two products.

For any help, please visit Transifex.com and our [documentation pages](http://docs.transifex.com) or contact us through there.
