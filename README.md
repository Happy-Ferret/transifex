What is Transifex?

that manages localization of digital products and supporting web content.
It focuses on integrating well with the existing workflow of fast-pased product
teams and translators.


About this repository
---------------------

Transifex used to be maintained as an open-source project on the side of
Transifex.com. Since mid 2012, this repository is
[no longer actively maintained](https://github.com/transifex/transifex/issues/206#issuecomment-15243207)
in favor of working aggressively in extending Transifex.com itself.

Maintaining both an open-source repo and Transifex.com was becoming much harder
with time and 99.9% of projects were hosted on Transifex.com anyway. We decided
to switch to a GitHub model where we work on one non-open codebase and
open-source the libraries which are actually useful for others.
